# Predicting-if-its-my-handrwiting
This model uses Neural Networks and Random Forests to determine if the input photo is my handwriting or not. 

All the data used has been taking by my phone and hence needed some preprocessing and data augmentation.
Neural networks don't seem to work well as they give some 60% accuracy at max on the train data while Random Forests give 100% on train and 80% on test data.
